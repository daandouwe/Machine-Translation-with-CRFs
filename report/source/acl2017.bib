                 algorithm and the familiar top-down algorithm. It has a
                 time bound proportional to $n^3$ (where $n$ is the
                 length of the string being parsed) in general; it has a
                 $n^2$ bound for unambiguous grammars; and it runs in
                 linear time on a large class of grammars, which seems
                 to include most practical context-free programming
                 language grammars. In an empirical comparison it
                 appears to be superior to the top-down and bottom-up
