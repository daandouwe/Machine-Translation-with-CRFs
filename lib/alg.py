    """
    This algorithm performs a recursive cleanup of the forest by deleting edges which will surely have 0 probability
    without actually computing probabilities.
    
    We do so by running inside-outside algorithm in the boolean semiring, 
    this tells us whether nodes are relevant to the forest (because it tells us whether some complete derivation
    goes through that node). 

    This is a **recursive** that does not require top-sorting and works even with cyclic forests.
    The reason why this works with cyclic forests is that in the boolean semiring there's a neat solution to avoid infinite loops
    (check below).

    :param root: Nonterminal/Span that represents the root of the forest
