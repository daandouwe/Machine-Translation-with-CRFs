主要 理由 大概 是 这样 的 。 在 高中 及 高考 补习 班 , 他们 必须 刻苦 用功 , 而 进入 大学 以后 , 他们 就 决心 享受 在 走上 社会 之前 的 一 段 人生 的 短暂 休息 时间 。 大家 都 知道 , 对于 工作 的 日本人 来说 , 现实 决非 悠哉悠哉 的 。 ||| the main reason is that in high schools and prep schools for university entrance exams they had to study so hard that when they get to college they 're determined to enjoy a short period of respite in their lives before joining the work force . everybody knows that the reality of japanese workers ' lives is no bed of roses . ||| the main reason is that since they push themselves so hard to study in high school and university entrance exam prep schools , once they enter the university , they are set on taking it easy for a short time before they have to start working . everyone knows that in reality , japanese workers ' lives are no picnic . ||| the primary reason is that when they are in high school and university entrance exam preparatory schools , they have to study so hard so when they get into the university , they are intent on enjoying themselves during the brief time they have before going out into the world to work . it 's well known that the truth of the matter is that the lives of workers in japan are not easy . ||| the basic reason is that because they drive themselves to study so hard in high school and in university entrance exam prep schools , when they do get into the university , they are intent on enjoying the short time they have before joining the working world . people know that the lives of people who work in japan are , in fact , no easy matter . ||| basically it 's because they had to study so hard in high school and prep school for the university entrance exams , when they do enter college they 're bent on enjoying life to the max for a short while until they enter the workforce . it 's common knowledge that the day-to-day reality of working life in japan is tough . ||| the principal reason is that they had to study so damned hard in high school and prep school for the university entrance exams that when they do go to college , they want to relax and enjoy themselves to the full for a while before they go into the adult workforce . it 's well know that the japanese working life is n't a picnic . ||| the biggest cause is that because they had to study such a lot in high school and prep school , they 're hell bent on living it up when they do enter college for a short while until they have to join the work force after graduation . everyone knows that the reality of japanese working life is fairly grim . ||| i think the main reason is that they had to study so hard during high school and prep school for university entrance exams , so when they get into university they are single-minded about enjoying that short break in their lives before entering the reality of working life . there is a general understanding about the harsh reality of working life in japan . ||| i would say that it 's mainly because they 've had to work so hard in high schools and university prep schools that once they get into university they 've decided that they 're going to enjoy that short moment of freedom in their lives before entering the work force . people have no misconceptions about the harsh realities of working life in japan . ||| the main reason they are determined to enjoy the short moment of respite in their lives before entering the work force is because they had to work so hard for high school and university prep school . and , everyone understands that working life in japan is not exactly easy . ||| probably , the main reason is that , since they had to study so hard in high school and prep school for university exams , when they enter university they are determined to enjoy a brief rest in life before they start working . we all know that the reality of japanese workers ' lives is no easy thing . ||| i guess the main reason for this is that it was necessary for them to study hard in high-school and prep school university exams , and so when they get to university they are resolved to enjoying a short rest in life before entering the working world . everyone knows that japanese workers do not have an easy time . ||| this is mainly because they had to study so seriously at high school and cram school for university exams that when they start university they are resolved to enjoying a short respite in life before working . it is clear to everyone that japanese people 's working lives are tough . ||| the main reason is because they had studied so hard in high school and prep school in order to get into university that they want to enjoy the short break before they enter the work force . everyone knows the harsh reality of the japanese worker . ||| the main reason is that they had to study so hard in high school and prep school to get into university they want to take a break before they get a job . it is common knowledge that japanese workers have tough lives . ||| i think the main reason is this . in order to get into university they had to study a lot in high school and prep school . they want to take it easy for the short period before they start working . everyone knows that it is tough being a japanese worker .
